Since the source files that include it are C, the compiler tries to interpret the header file as C and errors. Also, there are other differences that make it incompatible with the v0 API on console\n\n=================================================\nFollow these steps to solve the problem:\n1) Explore the repository to find relevant codes.\n2) Write a test code file to reproduce the problem and test your answer. Run your test file to see if it can reproduce the problem.\n3) Edit codes to solve the problem.\n4) Run your test file to validate your answer. If the test fails, go back to explore and edit again.\n5) If you pass your test, use submit tool call to submit.\n=================================================\nNote:\n1) Each of your response should contain exactly one tool call.\n2) Only edit existing files instead of creating new files, except that you can create a test file."
