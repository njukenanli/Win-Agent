Please describe**:\nMicrosoft has update their OEM license activation standard from SLIC to MSDM. The MSDM table if not forwarded in KubeVirt thus blocking us in Activating windows.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**:\nInclude the MSDM table in KubeVirt. SLIC support was implemented in https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/10774 by @victortoso. Would be great if a similar implementation would be done for MSDM.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**:\n\n- Tested solutions read the key from the table and enter it with an alternative flow - this does not work as Microsoft has implemented additional control methods to block manual activation.\n- Asked the hardware vendor to include SLIC, but he is not allowed to provide Microsoft licenses in SLIC format anymore.\n\n\n\n=================================================\nFollow these steps to solve the problem:\n1) Explore the repository to find relevant codes.\n2) Write a test code file to reproduce the problem and test your answer. Run your test file to see if it can reproduce the problem.\n3) Edit codes to solve the problem.\n4) Run your test file to validate your answer. If the test fails, go back to explore and edit again.\n5) If you pass your test, use submit tool call to submit.\n=================================================\nNote:\n1) Each of your response should contain exactly one tool call.\n2) Only edit existing files instead of creating new files, except that you can create a test file."
