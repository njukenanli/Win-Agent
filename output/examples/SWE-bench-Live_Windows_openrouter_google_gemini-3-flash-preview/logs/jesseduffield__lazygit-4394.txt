  "content": "You are given a code repository at C:\\testbed\nYou are in Windows powershell\nYou need to solve the following problem:\nLazygit hangs when creating a new tag with `tag.gpgSign = true` and empty description\n## Describe the bug\r\nWhen `tag.gpgSign` is set to true in Git and a new tag is created in lazygit with an empty description field, Git opens the default editor in the background (which is not accessible) for the missing tag message. Lazygit then waits for it to exit, which never happens. This leaves Lazygit in a state where it is still somewhat usable but very sluggish, for example, keyboard inputs art missing. You have to kill the editor manually.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n- Set tag.gpgSign to true in your git configuration `git config tag.gpgSign true`.\r\n- Open lazygit.\r\n- Create a new tag and leave the description field empty.\r\n- Observe that lazygit hangs ('creating tag' in status bar), waiting for the hidden editor to close.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nLazygit should handle the tag creation gracefully, either by enforcing a tag message or by handling the case where the description field is empty without hanging.\r\n\r\nVersion info:\r\nlazygit: *commit=5e388e21c8ca6aa883dbcbe45c47f6fdd5116815, build date=2023-08-07T14:05:48Z, build source=binaryRelease, version=0.40.2, os=windows, arch=amd64, git version=2.42.0.windows.1*\r\ngit: *git version 2.42.0.windows.1*\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nThis issue appears to be specific to the combination of using tag.gpgSign and leaving the tag description field empty in lazygit. \r\nI assume the default behavior is to create a lightweight tag when the description field is empty. I think Lazygit should consider the `tag.gpgSign` setting and give a hint when the description field is empty and `tag.gpgSign` is set to true.\r\n\r\n## Debug log\r\n```\r\nAug 23 11:17:25 |INFO|

Write a test code file to reproduce the problem and test your answer. Run your test file to see if it can reproduce the problem.\n3) Edit codes to solve the problem.\n4) Run your test file to validate your answer. If the test fails, go back to explore and edit again.\n5) If you pass your test, use submit tool call to submit.\n=================================================\nNote:\n1) Each of your response should contain exactly one tool call.\n2) Only edit existing files instead of creating new files, except that you can create a test file."
