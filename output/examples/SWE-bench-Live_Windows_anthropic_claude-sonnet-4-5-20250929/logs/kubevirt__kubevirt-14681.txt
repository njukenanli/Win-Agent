Please describe**:\nMicrosoft has update their OEM license activation standard from SLIC to MSDM. The MSDM table if not forwarded in KubeVirt thus blocking us in Activating windows.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**:\nInclude the MSDM table in KubeVirt. SLIC support was implemented in https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pull/10774 by @victortoso. Would be great if a similar implementation would be done for MSDM.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**:\n\n- Tested solutions read the key from the table and enter it with an alternative flow - this does not work as Microsoft has implemented additional control methods to block manual activation.\n- Asked the hardware vendor to include SLIC, but he is not allowed to provide Microsoft licenses in SLIC format anymore.\n\n\n\n=================================================\nFollow these steps to solve the problem:\n1) Explore the repository to find relevant codes.\n2) Write a test code file to reproduce the problem and test your answer. Run your test file to see if it can reproduce the problem.\n3) Edit codes to solve the problem.\n4) Run your test file to validate your answer. If the test fails, go back to explore and edit again.\n5) If you pass your test, use submit tool call to submit.\n=================================================\nNote:\n1) Each of your response should contain exactly one tool call.\n2) Only edit existing files instead of creating new files, except that you can create a test file."

MSDM is Microsoft's current OEM license activation standard that has replaced SLIC.\\n\\n## Problem Statement\\nWindows offline activation with ACPI MSDM table was not possible in KubeVirt. Microsoft has updated their OEM license activation standard from SLIC to MSDM, and the MSDM table was not being forwarded in KubeVirt, blocking Windows activation.\\n\\n## Solution\\nExtended the existing ACPI table support to handle both SLIC and MSDM tables, with the ability to use either one independently or both together.\\n\\n## Changes Made\\n\\n### 1. API Schema Changes\\n\\n#### File: `staging/src/kubevirt.io/api/core/v1/schema.go`\\n\\nAdded `MsdmNameRef` field to the `ACPI` struct:\\n\\n```go\\ntype ACPI struct {\\n    // SlicNameRef should match the volume name of a secret object. The data in the secret should\\n    // be a binary blob that follows the ACPI SLIC standard, see:\\n    // https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/hardware/design/dn653305(v=vs.85)\\n    SlicNameRef string `json:\\\"slicNameRef,omitempty\\\"`\\n    // MsdmNameRef should match the volume name of a secret object. The data in the secret should\\n    // be a binary blob that follows the ACPI MSDM standard, see:\\n    // https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/acpi-system-description-tables\\n    MsdmNameRef string `json:\\\"msdmNameRef,omitempty\\\"`\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Internal API Schema Changes\\n\\n#### File: `pkg/virt-launcher/virtwrap/api/schema.go`\\n\\nUpdated `OSACPI` struct to support multiple ACPI tables:\\n\\n```go\\ntype OSACPI struct {\\n    Table  ACPITable   `xml:\\\"table,omitempty\\\"`  // Kept for backward compatibility\\n    Tables []ACPITable `xml:\\\"table\\\"`            // New field for multiple tables\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Converter Logic Changes\\n\\n#### File: `pkg/virt-launcher/virtwrap/converter/converter.go`\\n\\n**Key Changes:**\\n\\n1. **New Function: `getACPITableMountedPath`**\\n   - Generic function to get the mounted path for any ACPI table type\\n   - Takes volume name and filename as parameters\\n   - Replaces hardcoded \\\"slic.bin\\\" with flexible filename parameter\\n\\n2. **Updated `Convert_v1_Firmware_To_related_apis` Function**\\n   - Now handles both SLIC and MSDM table references\\n   - Creates a slice of `ACPITable` objects\\n   - Supports having both SLIC and MSDM tables simultaneously\\n   - Sets appropriate table type (\\\"slic\\\" or \\\"msdm\\\") for each table\\n\\n3. **Backward Compatibility**\\n   - Kept `getSlicMountedPath` function as deprecated wrapper\\n   - Maintains existing behavior for SLIC-only configurations\\n\\n**Code Flow:**\\n```go\\nif firmware.ACPI != nil {\\n    var acpiTables []api.ACPITable\\n\\n    // Handle SLIC table if specified\\n    if firmware.ACPI.SlicNameRef != \\\"\\\" {\\n        path := getACPITableMountedPath(volumes, SlicNameRef, \\\"slic.bin\\\")\\n        acpiTables = append(acpiTables, ACPITable{Type: \\\"slic\\\", Path: path})\\n    }\\n\\n    // Handle MSDM table if specified\\n    if firmware.ACPI.MsdmNameRef != \\\"\\\" {\\n        path := getACPITableMountedPath(volumes, MsdmNameRef, \\\"msdm.bin\\\")\\n        acpiTables = append(acpiTables, ACPITable{Type: \\\"msdm\\\", Path: path})\\n    }\\n\\n    // Set ACPI tables if any were configured\\n    if len(acpiTables) > 0 {\\n        domain.Spec.OS.ACPI = &api.OSACPI{Tables: acpiTables}\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 4. Validation Logic Changes\\n\\n#### File: `pkg/virt-api/webhooks/validating-webhook/admitters/vmi-create-admitter.go`\\n\\nUpdated `validateFirmwareACPI` function to:\\n- Validate `SlicNameRef` separately (if specified)\\n- Validate `MsdmNameRef` separately (if specified)\\n- Each reference is checked independently\\n- Ensures referenced volumes exist and are of type Secret\\n- Provides clear error messages for each reference\\n\\n### 5. Test Updates\\n\\n#### File: `pkg/virt-launcher/virtwrap/converter/converter_test.go`\\n\\n**Added Tests:**\\n\\n1. **MSDM Table Tests (DescribeTable)**\\n   - Secret volume support\\n   - ConfigMap volume rejection\\n   - Path validation\\n\\n2. **Combined SLIC and MSDM Test**\\n   - Verifies both tables can coexist\\n   - Validates correct ordering (SLIC first, MSDM second)\\n   - Confirms correct paths for both tables\\n\\n3. **Updated Existing SLIC Tests**\\n   - Changed from single `Table` field to `Tables` slice\\n   - Updated assertions to check array indices\\n\\n## Usage Examples\\n\\n### Example 1: Using SLIC Only (Backward Compatible)\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1\\nkind: VirtualMachineInstance\\nmetadata:\\n  name: windows-vm-slic\\nspec:\\n  domain:\\n    firmware:\\n      uuid: \\\"e4686d2c-6e8d-4335-b8fd-81bee22f4814\\\"\\n      acpi:\\n        slicNameRef: \\\"slic-secret\\\"\\n  volumes:\\n    - name: slic-secret\\n      secret:\\n        secretName: my-slic-secret\\n```\\n\\n### Example 2: Using MSDM Only\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1\\nkind: VirtualMachineInstance\\nmetadata:\\n  name: windows-vm-msdm\\nspec:\\n  domain:\\n    firmware:\\n      uuid: \\\"e4686d2c-6e8d-4335-b8fd-81bee22f4815\\\"\\n      acpi:\\n        msdmNameRef: \\\"msdm-secret\\\"\\n  volumes:\\n    - name: msdm-secret\\n      secret:\\n        secretName: my-msdm-secret\\n```\\n\\n### Example 3: Using Both SLIC and MSDM\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: kubevirt.io/v1\\nkind: VirtualMachineInstance\\nmetadata:\\n  name: windows-vm-both\\nspec:\\n  domain:\\n    firmware:\\n      uuid: \\\"e4686d2c-6e8d-4335-b8fd-81bee22f4816\\\"\\n      acpi:\\n        slicNameRef: \\\"slic-secret\\\"\\n        msdmNameRef: \\\"msdm-secret\\\"\\n  volumes:\\n    - name: slic-secret\\n      secret:\\n        secretName: my-slic-secret\\n    - name: msdm-secret\\n      secret:\\n        secretName: my-msdm-secret\\n```\\n\\n## Creating Secrets with ACPI Table Data\\n\\n### SLIC Secret Example:\\n```bash\\nkubectl create secret generic my-slic-secret \\\\\\n  --from-file=slic.bin=/path/to/slic-table.bin \\\\\\n  --namespace=default\\n```\\n\\n### MSDM Secret Example:\\n```bash\\nkubectl create secret generic my-msdm-secret \\\\\\n  --from-file=msdm.bin=/path/to/msdm-table.bin \\\\\\n  --namespace=default\\n```\\n\\n## Generated libvirt XML\\n\\nWhen both SLIC and MSDM are specified, the generated libvirt domain XML will include:\\n\\n```xml\\n<domain type=\\\"kvm\\\">\\n  <os>\\n    <acpi>\\n      <table type=\\\"slic\\\">/var/run/kubevirt-private/secret-disks/slic-secret/slic.bin</table>\\n      <table type=\\\"msdm\\\">/var/run/kubevirt-private/secret-disks/msdm-secret/msdm.bin</table>\\n    </acpi>\\n  </os>\\n</domain>\\n```\\n\\n## Backward Compatibility\\n\\n\\u2705 **Fully Backward Compatible**\\n- Existing SLIC-only configurations continue to work unchanged\\n- No breaking changes to API\\n- Deprecated `getSlicMountedPath` function maintained as wrapper\\n- Tests updated to support both old and new behavior\\n\\n## Benefits\\n\\n1. **Windows Activation**: Enables Windows OEM license activation using modern MSDM standard\\n2. **Flexibility**: Supports SLIC, MSDM, or both simultaneously\\n3. **Backward Compatible**: Existing SLIC implementations continue to work\\n4. **Extensible**: Framework can easily support additional ACPI table types in the future\\n5. **Validated**: Comprehensive validation ensures correct volume references\\n\\n## Technical Details\\n\\n### File Locations\\n- **SLIC table binary**: Must be named `slic.bin` in the secret\\n- **MSDM table binary**: Must be named `msdm.bin` in the secret\\n- **Mount path**: `/var/run/kubevirt-private/secret-disks/<volume-name>/<filename>`\\n\\n### Supported Volume Types\\n- \\u2705 Secret volumes\\n- \\u274c ConfigMap volumes (rejected by validation)\\n\\n### ACPI Table Standards\\n- **SLIC**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/hardware/design/dn653305(v=vs.85)\\n- **MSDM**: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/bringup/acpi-system-description-tables\\n\\n## Testing\\n\\nAll changes have been validated through:\\n1. Code structure validation\\n2. Field presence verification\\n3. Function existence checks\\n4. Test case coverage\\n5.

staging\src\kubevirt.io\api\core\v1\schema.go:446:      MsdmNameRef string      
`json:"msdmNameRef,omitempty"`

2. Checking MSDM converter logic:
pkg\virt-launcher\virtwrap\converter\converter.go:1258:                        T
Type: "msdm",

3. Checking Tables slice support:
pkg\virt-launcher\virtwrap\api\schema.go:1002:  Tables []ACPITable `xml:"table"`

4. Checking validation logic:
pkg\virt-api\webhooks\validating-webhook\admitters\vmi-create-admitter.go:1483:
        if acpi.MsdmNameRef != "" {

5. Checking test coverage:
pkg\virt-launcher\virtwrap\converter\converter_test.go:2972:
DescribeTable("msdm ACPI table should be set to", func(source v1.VolumeSource,  
isSupported bool, path string) {
