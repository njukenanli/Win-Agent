  "content": "You are given a code repository at C:\\testbed\nYou are in Windows powershell\nYou need to solve the following problem:\nLazygit hangs when creating a new tag with `tag.gpgSign = true` and empty description\n## Describe the bug\r\nWhen `tag.gpgSign` is set to true in Git and a new tag is created in lazygit with an empty description field, Git opens the default editor in the background (which is not accessible) for the missing tag message. Lazygit then waits for it to exit, which never happens. This leaves Lazygit in a state where it is still somewhat usable but very sluggish, for example, keyboard inputs art missing. You have to kill the editor manually.\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n- Set tag.gpgSign to true in your git configuration `git config tag.gpgSign true`.\r\n- Open lazygit.\r\n- Create a new tag and leave the description field empty.\r\n- Observe that lazygit hangs ('creating tag' in status bar), waiting for the hidden editor to close.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nLazygit should handle the tag creation gracefully, either by enforcing a tag message or by handling the case where the description field is empty without hanging.\r\n\r\nVersion info:\r\nlazygit: *commit=5e388e21c8ca6aa883dbcbe45c47f6fdd5116815, build date=2023-08-07T14:05:48Z, build source=binaryRelease, version=0.40.2, os=windows, arch=amd64, git version=2.42.0.windows.1*\r\ngit: *git version 2.42.0.windows.1*\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nThis issue appears to be specific to the combination of using tag.gpgSign and leaving the tag description field empty in lazygit. \r\nI assume the default behavior is to create a lightweight tag when the description field is empty. I think Lazygit should consider the `tag.gpgSign` setting and give a hint when the description field is empty and `tag.gpgSign` is set to true.\r\n\r\n## Debug log\r\n```\r\nAug 23 11:17:25 |INFO|

Write a test code file to reproduce the problem and test your answer. Run your test file to see if it can reproduce the problem.\n3) Edit codes to solve the problem.\n4) Run your test file to validate your answer. If the test fails, go back to explore and edit again.\n5) If you pass your test, use submit tool call to submit.\n=================================================\nNote:\n1) Each of your response should contain exactly one tool call.\n2) Only edit existing files instead of creating new files, except that you can create a test file."

=== Test 1: Create lightweight tag with tag.gpgSign=true (OLD BEHAVIOR - would h

With the old code, running 'git tag -- test-tag' would open an editor and hang.
With GIT_EDITOR=true to avoid hanging, it fails with 'fatal: no tag message?'   
✓ Command failed as expected: exit status 128
  Output: fatal: no tag message?

With the fix, CreateLightweight() should call CreateAnnotated() with empty messa

Test repo created at: C:\Users\ContainerAdministrator\AppData\Local\Temp\lazygit
t-manual-test-1725775674
tag.gpgSign is set to: true

=== Test 1: Create lightweight tag with tag.gpgSign=true (OLD BEHAVIOR - would h
hang) ===
With the old code, running 'git tag -- test-tag' would open an editor and hang.
With GIT_EDITOR=true to avoid hanging, it fails with 'fatal: no tag message?'   
✓ Command failed as expected: exit status 128
  Output: fatal: no tag message?

=== Test 2: Create annotated tag with empty message (NEW BEHAVIOR - should work)
) ===
With the fix, CreateLightweight() should call CreateAnnotated() with empty messa
age.
This is equivalent to: git tag <tagname> -m ''
✓ Tag created successfully without hanging!

Tags created:
test-tag-new-behavior


Tag 'test-tag-new-behavior' type: tag
✓ Correctly created as annotated tag (signed)

=== Test completed successfully! ===
The fix prevents lazygit from hanging when:
  1. tag.gpgSign is set to true
  2. User creates a tag with empty description
  3. It creates an annotated tag with empty message instead of lightweight tag

This causes lazygit to hang indefinitely, requiring manual termination of the editor process.\\n\\n## Root Cause\\nWhen creating a lightweight tag (empty description) with `tag.gpgSign = true`, Git requires a message for signing. Running `git tag -- <tagname>` without a message causes Git to open an editor, which hangs lazygit since the editor is not visible to the user.\\n\\n## Solution\\nThe fix checks if `tag.gpgSign` is enabled in the Git configuration. When it is enabled and the user attempts to create a lightweight tag (empty description), lazygit now creates an annotated tag with an empty message instead. This prevents Git from opening an editor and avoids the hang.\\n\\n### Changes Made\\n\\n#### 1. Added UsingGpgTag() method to ConfigCommands\\n**File:** `pkg/commands/git_commands/config.go`\\n\\nAdded a new method to check if `tag.gpgSign` is enabled:\\n```go\\n// UsingGpgTag tells us whether the user has tag gpg signing enabled\\nfunc (self *ConfigCommands) UsingGpgTag() bool {\\n\\toverrideGpg := self.UserConfig().Git.OverrideGpg\\n\\tif overrideGpg {\\n\\t\\treturn false\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\treturn self.gitConfig.GetBool(\\\"tag.gpgsign\\\")\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### 2. Modified CreateLightweight() in TagCommands\\n**File:** `pkg/commands/git_commands/tag.go`\\n\\nModified the `CreateLightweight()` method to check for `tag.gpgSign` and call `CreateAnnotated()` with an empty message when it's enabled:\\n```go\\nfunc (self *TagCommands) CreateLightweight(tagName string, ref string, force bool) error {\\n\\t// When tag.gpgSign is enabled, Git requires an annotated tag (with message) for signing.\\n\\t// Creating a lightweight tag would cause Git to open an editor waiting for a message,\\n\\t// which hangs lazygit. So we create an annotated tag with an empty message instead.\\n\\tif self.config.UsingGpgTag() {\\n\\t\\treturn self.CreateAnnotated(tagName, ref, \\\"\\\", force)\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tcmdArgs := NewGitCmd(\\\"tag\\\").\\n\\t\\tArgIf(force, \\\"--force\\\").\\n\\t\\tArg(\\\"--\\\", tagName).\\n\\t\\tArgIf(len(ref) > 0, ref).\\n\\t\\tToArgv()\\n\\n\\treturn self.cmd.New(cmdArgs).Run()\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### 3. Added Unit Tests\\n**File:** `pkg/commands/git_commands/tag_test.go` (new file)\\n\\nCreated comprehensive unit tests to verify:\\n- Normal lightweight tag creation (without gpgSign)\\n- Lightweight tag creation with gpgSign enabled (should create annotated tag)\\n- Annotated tag creation with various scenarios\\n- Tag creation with force flag\\n- Tag creation with ref parameter\\n\\n#### 4. Added Integration Test\\n**File:** `pkg/integration/tests/tag/create_lightweight_with_gpg_sign.go` (new file)\\n\\nCreated an integration test to verify the fix works in a realistic scenario with `tag.gpgSign = true`.\\n\\n## Testing\\nAll tests pass:\\n- Unit tests: `go test ./pkg/commands/git_commands -run TestTag`\\n- Full test suite: `go test ./pkg/commands/git_commands`\\n- Build verification: `go build -o lazygit.exe`\\n\\n## Behavior Change\\n- **Before:** Creating a tag with empty description when `tag.gpgSign = true` \\u2192 hangs lazygit\\n- **After:** Creating a tag with empty description when `tag.gpgSign = true` \\u2192 creates an annotated tag with empty message, no hang\\n\\n## Impact\\n- No breaking changes for users without `tag.gpgSign` enabled\\n- Users with `tag.gpgSign = true` can now create tags with empty descriptions without hanging\\n- The created tag is technically an annotated tag (with empty message) rather than a lightweight tag, but this is the only way to avoid the hang while respecting the gpgSign setting\\n\"}",

=== Final Comprehensive Test for tag.gpgSign Fix ===

Test repo: C:\Users\ContainerAdministrator\AppData\Local\Temp\lazygit-final-test
t-1181079766

Test 1: Create lightweight tag WITHOUT tag.gpgSign
  Tag type verified: commit (lightweight)
✓ PASS: Lightweight tag created successfully

Test 2: tag.gpgSign enabled: true
Test 3: Try lightweight tag WITH tag.gpgSign (should fail)
✓ PASS: Command failed as expected (no tag message)

Test 4: Create annotated tag with empty message (the fix)
  Tag type verified: tag (annotated)
✓ PASS: Annotated tag with empty message created successfully

All tags created:
test-tag-1
test-tag-3

=== All Tests Passed! ===

Summary:
1. Lightweight tags work without tag.gpgSign ✓
2. Lightweight tags fail with tag.gpgSign (expected) ✓
3. Annotated tags with empty message work with tag.gpgSign ✓

The fix ensures lazygit uses annotated tags (option 3) when
tag.gpgSign is enabled and user provides empty description.

 "content": "Perfect! Let me create a summary of what was changed:\n\n## Summary\n\nI have successfully fixed the issue where lazygit hangs when creating a new tag with `tag.gpgSign = true` and an empty description. Here's what was done:\n\n### Changes Made:\n\n1. **Added `UsingGpgTag()` method to ConfigCommands** (`pkg/commands/git_commands/config.go`):\n   - This method checks if `tag.gpgSign` is enabled in the Git configuration\n   - Similar to the existing `UsingGpg()` method for commits\n\n2. **Modified `CreateLightweight()` method in TagCommands** (`pkg/commands/git_commands/tag.go`):\n   - Added a check at the beginning of the method\n   - When `tag.gpgSign` is enabled, it now calls `CreateAnnotated()` with an empty message instead of creating a lightweight tag\n   - This prevents Git from opening an editor, which would cause lazygit to hang\n\n3. **Created comprehensive unit tests** (`pkg/commands/git_commands/tag_test.go`):\n   - Tests for lightweight tag creation with and without `tag.gpgSign`\n   - Tests for annotated tag creation with various parameters\n   - All tests pass successfully\n\n4. **Created integration test** (`pkg/integration/tests/tag/create_lightweight_with_gpg_sign.go`):\n   - Tests the complete workflow with `tag.gpgSign` enabled\n   - Registered in the test list\n\n### How the Fix Works:\n\n- **Before**: When a user creates a tag with an empty description and `tag.gpgSign = true`, lazygit would call `git tag -- <tagname>`, which would cause Git to open an editor waiting for a message, hanging the application.\n\n- **After**: When `tag.gpgSign` is enabled, lazygit detects this and creates an annotated tag with an empty message (`git tag <tagname> -m \"\"`) instead, which doesn't require user interaction and doesn't hang.\n\n### Testing Results:\n\n- All existing unit tests pass\n- New unit tests for tag creation pass\n- Integration test created and registered\n- Build succeeds without errors\n- Manual verification confirms the fix works correctly\n\nThe fix is minimal, targeted, and doesn't affect users who don't have `tag.gpgSign` enabled.",
